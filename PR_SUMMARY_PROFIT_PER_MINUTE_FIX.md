# Pull Request Summary: Profit Per Minute Bug Fix

## 🐛 Bug Report
User reported that the profit per minute calculation was completely wrong, showing values approximately 19-20 times higher than expected.

**Example: Dog Treats to Canada**
- Total profit for 19 items: $124,557.34
- Round trip time: 58 minutes (29 min each way)
- **Expected**: $124,557 / 58 = ~$2,147 per minute
- **Actual shown**: $41,229 per minute (19× too high!)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
Double multiplication was occurring:

1. **API calculation** (already correct):
   ```typescript
   profit_per_minute = (sold_profit * MAX_FOREIGN_ITEMS) / (travel_time_minutes * 2)
   profit_per_minute = (6555.65 * 19) / (28.7 * 2) = 2169.99  ✓
   ```

2. **UI display** (bug was here):
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (wrong):
   {formatCurrency(applyMultiplier(item.profit_per_minute))}
   // This multiplied 2169.99 * 19 = 41,229 ✗
   
   // AFTER (fixed):
   {formatCurrency(item.profit_per_minute)}
   // This displays 2169.99 directly ✓
   ```

The `profit_per_minute` value already represents the total profit rate for all 19 items. The UI's `applyMultiplier` function was designed for per-item values (like `buy_price`, `sold_profit`), but was incorrectly being applied to the already-totaled `profit_per_minute`.

## ✅ Solution
Removed `applyMultiplier()` from `profit_per_minute` display in two locations:
- Line 862: Table view
- Line 945: Expanded card view

**Total changes: 2 lines of code modified**

## 📈 Impact

### What Changed
- **Profit/Min display**: Now shows correct value without extra multiplication
  - Before: $41,229 ❌
  - After: $2,170 ✅

### What Didn't Change
All other values continue to work correctly with the "Multiply by 19" checkbox:
- ✅ Buy Price: $842 → $16,000 (when checked)
- ✅ Sold Profit: $6,556 → $124,557 (when checked)
- ✅ All other per-item metrics

### Why This Makes Sense
`profit_per_minute` is a **rate metric** (profit per unit time) that already accounts for all items in the trip. Multiplying it by 19 would incorrectly imply "profit per minute if making 19 trips per minute" which is nonsensical.

Per-item values like `sold_profit` should be multiplied to show total profit, but rate metrics like `profit_per_minute` should not.

## 🎯 Verification
User's calculation verified:
```
Total profit: $124,557
Round trip: 58 minutes (29 × 2, as user stated)
Expected profit/min: $124,557 / 58 = $2,147

Actual (more precise):
One-way: 41 min × 0.70 (private island) = 28.7 min
Round trip: 28.7 × 2 = 57.4 min
Profit/min: $124,557 / 57.4 = $2,170 ✓
```

The small difference ($2,147 vs $2,170) is due to display rounding (29m shown vs 28.7m actual) and floating-point precision. The fix is mathematically correct.
