## Command Comparison

| Command | Purpose | Autocomplete |

- ‚úÖ = Job is enabled and running
- ‚ùå = Job is disabled and not running
- "Last run: X minutes ago" = Relative timestamp
- "Never run" = Job hasn't executed yet

## Tips

1. **Use autocomplete** - Start typing the job name to filter options
2. **Check status first** - Use `/listjobs` before making changes
3. **One at a time** - Disable jobs gradually to see the impact
4. **Monitor logs** - Check application logs to verify jobs are skipped
5. **Check last run** - Verify jobs are actually running by checking timestamps
