# Background Fetcher Service

This service automatically fetches and stores Torn API data into MongoDB, ensuring up-to-date information without exceeding API rate limits. It dynamically tracks the top 10 most profitable items per country and stores detailed market snapshots.

## Features

### Rate Limiting
- Uses Bottleneck to enforce â‰¤60 requests/minute
- Implements exponential backoff retry logic for HTTP 429 errors
- Minimum 1 second between requests

### Dynamic Item Tracking
- **Automatically determines** top 10 most profitable items per country
- No hardcoded item IDs - selections are data-driven
- Based on profitPer1 (market_price - buy_price)
- Updates selections every 10 minutes
- Tracks item availability and stock levels

### Scheduled Data Fetching

#### Daily (3 AM)
- **Torn Items Catalog**: All items with vendor and pricing information
  - Endpoint: `https://api.torn.com/v2/torn/items?cat=All&sort=ASC&key=${API_KEY}`
  - Cached for 24 hours to avoid unnecessary API calls
  - Stored in `TornItem` collection

#### Every 10 Minutes
- **Update Tracked Items**: Dynamically determine top 10 profitable items per country
  - Analyzes all items and calculates profit margins
  - Updates `TrackedItem` collection with current selections
  - Logs tracked item names per country

#### Self-Scheduling Market Snapshots
- **Market Snapshots**: Detailed market data for tracked items
  - Endpoint: `https://api.torn.com/v2/market/{itemId}/itemmarket?limit=20&key=${API_KEY}`
  - **Self-scheduling**: Runs continuously with intelligent rate limiting
  - After each complete cycle, calculates wait time to respect 60 requests/minute limit
  - Starts next cycle immediately if no wait needed, or after calculated delay
  - Stores complete market data including all listings
  - Historical snapshots preserved for trend analysis
  - Stored in `MarketSnapshot` collection

**How Self-Scheduling Works:**
1. Fetches market data for all tracked items across all countries
2. Tracks total API calls made during cycle
3. Calculates minimum time needed: `(totalApiCalls / 60) * 60 seconds`
4. Compares with actual elapsed time
5. Waits additional time if needed to respect rate limit
6. Automatically starts next cycle

Example: If 30 API calls took 20 seconds, minimum time = 30 seconds, so waits 10 more seconds before next cycle.

#### Every Minute
- **City Shop Stock**: Torn city shop inventory and stock levels
  - Endpoint: `https://api.torn.com/v2/torn?selections=cityshops&key=${API_KEY}`
  - Stored in `CityShopStock` collection

- **Foreign Travel Stock**: YATA travel stock data
  - Endpoint: `https://yata.yt/api/v1/travel/export/`
  - Stored in `ForeignStock` collection
  - Maps country codes to readable names

## MongoDB Collections

### MarketSnapshot (NEW)
Stores complete market data snapshots:
- `country`: Country where item is sold
- `itemId`, `name`, `type`: Item identification
- `shopName`: Vendor name
- `buy_price`, `market_price`, `profitPer1`: Pricing and profit
- `in_stock`: Current stock level
- `listings`: Array of market listings with `{ price, amount }`
- `cache_timestamp`: API cache timestamp
- `fetched_at`: When snapshot was taken

**Purpose**: Historical market data for analyzing which profitable items actually sell

### TrackedItem (NEW)
Stores dynamically selected items per country:
- `country`: Country name
- `itemIds`: Array of top 10 profitable item IDs
- `lastUpdated`: Last selection update timestamp

**Purpose**: Maintains list of items to monitor for each country

### TornItem
Stores basic item information and vendor details:
- `itemId`: Unique item identifier
- `name`, `description`, `type`
- `vendor_country`, `vendor_name`
- `buy_price`, `sell_price`, `market_price`
- `lastUpdated`: Timestamp of last update

### CityShopStock
Stores Torn city shop inventory:
- `shopId`, `shopName`
- `itemId`, `itemName`
- `price`, `in_stock`
- `lastUpdated`

### ForeignStock
Stores foreign travel shop stock:
- `countryCode`, `countryName`
- `itemId`, `itemName`
- `quantity`, `cost`
- `lastUpdated`

### ItemMarket (DEPRECATED)
Legacy collection - use MarketSnapshot instead for detailed market data.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
TORN_API_KEY=your_torn_api_key_here
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/wasteland_rpg
```

## Usage

The background fetcher starts automatically when the server starts:

```typescript
import { startScheduler } from './services/backgroundFetcher';

// After database connection
startScheduler();
```

## Key Functions

### `updateTrackedItems()`
Dynamically determines and stores top 10 profitable items per country:
1. Fetches all items from database
2. Calculates profitPer1 for each item
3. Groups items by country
4. Selects top 10 by profit per country
5. Updates TrackedItem collection
6. Logs: "Tracking top 10 profitable items in {country}: [item names]"

### `fetchMarketSnapshots()`
Collects detailed market data for tracked items with self-scheduling:
1. Reads tracked items from TrackedItem collection
2. Fetches market data from Torn API for each item
3. Stores complete response including listings array
4. Preserves historical snapshots
5. Logs: "Stored {n} listings for {country} in MongoDB"
6. **Calculates intelligent delay based on API calls made**
7. **Self-schedules next cycle after appropriate wait time**

**Self-Scheduling Logic:**
- Tracks total API calls and elapsed time
- Ensures compliance with 60 requests/minute rate limit
- Minimum wait = (totalApiCalls / 60) minutes
- Adjusts for actual time taken
- Logs wait time before next cycle
- On error, retries after 2 minutes

## API Integration

The `/profit` endpoint now reads from MongoDB instead of making API calls:

```typescript
GET /api/profit
```

Returns grouped profit data by country with stock information merged from the database.

## Sample Market Snapshot Data

```json
{
  "country": "Mexico",
  "itemId": 180,
  "name": "Bottle of Beer",
  "type": "Alcohol",
  "shopName": "Mexican Store",
  "buy_price": 500,
  "market_price": 600,
  "profitPer1": 100,
  "in_stock": 250,
  "listings": [
    { "price": 600, "amount": 2 },
    { "price": 600, "amount": 31 }
  ],
  "cache_timestamp": 1759566303,
  "fetched_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Logging Output

```

```

Or with rate limiting:

```
Cycle completed: 120 API calls in 90.50 seconds
Waiting 29.50 seconds before next cycle to respect rate limit...
```

## Error Handling

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for rate-limited requests
- Comprehensive error logging using Winston logger
- Graceful handling of missing or empty API responses
- Database operations use bulk writes for better performance

## Development Notes

- The scheduler runs 24/7 in production
- Initial item fetch happens on startup if data is older than 24 hours
- Tracked items update 1 minute after startup, then every 10 minutes
- Market snapshots start ~65 seconds after startup (5 seconds after tracked items initialize), then use self-scheduling with intelligent rate limiting
- All timestamps use ISO 8601 format
- Bulk operations minimize database round trips
- Historical snapshots are never overwritten
