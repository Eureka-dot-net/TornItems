# Travel Time Rounding Fix

## Issue

The travel time calculation in the notification system was applying unnecessary rounding to base travel times for users without private islands. This could potentially lose precision if travel times ever included decimal values.

## Root Cause

In `API/src/discord/commands/notifyTravel.ts`, line 154 was applying `Math.round()` to the base travel time:

```typescript
const actualTravelTimeMinutes = user.hasPrivateIsland 
  ? Math.round(travelTime.travelTimeMinutes * 0.70 * 100) / 100
  : Math.round(travelTime.travelTimeMinutes);  // ← Unnecessary rounding
```

## Solution

Removed the unnecessary rounding for non-private island users to preserve precision:

```typescript
const actualTravelTimeMinutes = user.hasPrivateIsland 
  ? Math.round(travelTime.travelTimeMinutes * 0.70 * 100) / 100
  : travelTime.travelTimeMinutes;  // ← No rounding, preserves precision
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Travel Time Calculation
**File**: `API/src/discord/commands/notifyTravel.ts`

- **Line 154**: Changed from `Math.round(travelTime.travelTimeMinutes)` to `travelTime.travelTimeMinutes`
- **Impact**: Preserves decimal precision in base travel times

### 2. Added Comprehensive Tests
**File**: `API/tests/travelTimeRounding.test.ts` (new)

Created 5 test cases to validate:
- Non-private island users preserve exact travel time
- Private island users get correct discounted time with decimals
- Hypothetical decimal travel times are handled correctly
- All country travel times calculate correctly with private island

### 3. Updated Documentation
**File**: `FEEDBACK_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

Updated the "Private Island Rounding Fix" section to:
- Explain both private island and non-private island handling
- Show examples for both cases
- Clarify that base travel times should preserve precision

## Validation

All changes verified with:
- ✅ `npm run build` - Success
- ✅ `npm run lint` - Success (0 warnings)
- ✅ `npm test -- tests/travelTimeRounding.test.ts` - All 5 tests pass

## Impact

### Current Impact
Since base travel times in the database are currently all integers (26, 35, 41, etc.), the practical impact is minimal:
- For non-private island: `Math.round(26)` = `26` (same as just `26`)
- For private island: Still properly preserves decimals

### Future-Proofing
If travel times ever need decimal precision (e.g., 26.5 minutes), the system will now preserve them:
- **Before**: `Math.round(26.5)` = `27` (lost precision)
- **After**: `26.5` = `26.5` (preserved)

## Code Quality

The fix follows best practices:
- **Minimal change**: Only removed unnecessary rounding (1 line changed)
- **Backward compatible**: No behavioral change for current integer travel times
- **Well-tested**: Comprehensive test coverage for the logic
- **Documented**: Updated documentation to reflect the change

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works correctly:

```typescript
// Test Case 1: Non-private island (base time preserved)
const travelTimeMinutes = 26;
const hasPrivateIsland = false;
const result = hasPrivateIsland 
  ? Math.round(travelTimeMinutes * 0.70 * 100) / 100
  : travelTimeMinutes;
// Expected: 26

// Test Case 2: Private island (decimal preserved)
const travelTimeMinutes = 26;
const hasPrivateIsland = true;
const result = hasPrivateIsland 
  ? Math.round(travelTimeMinutes * 0.70 * 100) / 100
  : travelTimeMinutes;
// Expected: 18.2 (not 18)
```

## Summary

This fix ensures that travel time calculations preserve maximum precision by:
1. Only applying rounding when necessary (private island discount calculation)
2. Using base travel times as-is when no discount is applied
3. Maintaining the precision-preserving rounding for private island calculations

The change is minimal, well-tested, and future-proofs the system for potential decimal travel times.
