## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Points Market Detection
```typescript
if (itemId === 0) {
  isPointsMarket = true;
  // Use points market endpoint
  const response = await axios.get(
    `https://api.torn.com/v2/market?selections=pointsmarket&limit=20&key=${apiKey}`
  );
  // Parse pointsmarket object format
}
```

### Key Features

- ✅ Same deduplication and alert system
- ✅ Stock sell recommendations work correctly

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Adding Points Watch
```
/addwatch itemid:0 price:30000
/addwatch name:points price:30000
```

### Managing Points Watch
```
/listwatch          → Shows "Points (ID: 0)" in list
/editwatch itemid:0 price:29000  → Updates alert price
/disablewatch itemid:0           → Temporarily disables
/enablewatch itemid:0            → Re-enables
/removewatch itemid:0            → Removes watch
```

### Alert Example

🚨 Cheap item found!
💊 30x Points at $29,500 each (below $30,000)
