# Profit Per Minute Fix - Visual Comparison

## Before Fix ❌

### User sees in UI:
```
Dog Treats (Canada)
Buy Price: $16,000
Sold Profit: $124,557  (with "Multiply by 19" checked)
Travel Time: 29m (one-way)
Profit/Min: $41,229  ← WRONG! (19× too high)
```

### Calculation happening:
```javascript
// API (profit.ts line 336-338)
profit_per_minute = (sold_profit * 19) / (travel_time * 2)
profit_per_minute = (6555.65 * 19) / (28.7 * 2)
profit_per_minute = 124557.35 / 57.4
profit_per_minute = 2169.99  ✓ Correct so far

// UI (Profit.tsx line 862 - BEFORE fix)
displayed_value = applyMultiplier(profit_per_minute)
displayed_value = 2169.99 * 19  ← WRONG! Multiplied again!
displayed_value = 41,229.77  ✗ Displays incorrect value
```

## After Fix ✅

### User sees in UI:
```
Dog Treats (Canada)
Buy Price: $16,000
Sold Profit: $124,557  (with "Multiply by 19" checked)
Travel Time: 29m (one-way)
Profit/Min: $2,170  ← CORRECT! ✓
```

### Calculation happening:
```javascript
// API (profit.ts line 336-338) - UNCHANGED
profit_per_minute = (sold_profit * 19) / (travel_time * 2)
profit_per_minute = (6555.65 * 19) / (28.7 * 2)
profit_per_minute = 124557.35 / 57.4
profit_per_minute = 2169.99  ✓

// UI (Profit.tsx line 862 - AFTER fix)
displayed_value = profit_per_minute  ✓ No extra multiplication!
displayed_value = 2169.99  ✓ Displays correct value
```

## User's Expected Calculation Verified ✓
```
Total profit for 19 items: $124,557.34
Round trip time: 58 minutes (29 min each way)
Expected profit per minute: $124,557.34 / 58 = $2,147

Actual calculation (more precise):
- One-way time: 41 min * 0.70 (private island) = 28.7 min
- Round trip: 28.7 * 2 = 57.4 min
- Profit/min: $124,557.35 / 57.4 = $2,170 ✓

Close enough! The small difference is due to:
1. Display rounding (29m shown vs 28.7m actual)
2. Floating point precision
```

## Impact

### What Still Gets Multiplied ✓
When "Multiply by 19" is checked, these values correctly multiply:
- Buy Price: $842 → $16,000
- Sold Profit: $6,556 → $124,557
- All other per-item profit metrics

### What No Longer Gets Multiplied (Fixed) ✓
- **Profit/Min**: Now shows $2,170 instead of $41,229

This is correct because `profit_per_minute` is a rate metric that already accounts for all items in the trip. Multiplying it again would be like saying "how much profit per minute if I made 19 trips per minute" which makes no sense!

## Testing
8 comprehensive tests added in `API/tests/profitPerMinute.test.ts`:
- ✅ Basic calculation (Dog Treats example)
- ✅ Without private island
- ✅ Null handling (both sold_profit and travel_time)
- ✅ Real-world scenarios
- ✅ Negative profit
- ✅ Formula verification
- ✅ Bug documentation (showing wrong vs. correct behavior)

All tests passing! ✓
