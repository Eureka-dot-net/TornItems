# Stock Holdings Clearing Fix - Implementation Complete ✅

## Issue Resolved

**Problem:** Stock holdings were not being cleared when users sold all their shares. The Torn API doesn't return stocks the user no longer owns, so old holdings with non-zero shares remained as the most recent snapshot in the database.

**Impact:** Users saw incorrect holdings in their stock recommendations, showing stocks they had already sold.

## Solution Summary

Modified the `fetchUserStockHoldings()` function in `backgroundFetcher.ts` to:
1. Track which stocks are in the current API response
2. Query for previously owned stocks (total_shares > 0)
3. Create 0-share snapshots for stocks that are no longer in the API response
4. Log when stocks are detected as sold

This mirrors the existing pattern used in `fetchCityShopStock()` for handling items that go out of stock.

## Files Modified

### Code Changes
- **`API/src/services/backgroundFetcher.ts`** - Core fix (90 lines changed)
  - Added tracking of current stock IDs
  - Added aggregation query for previously owned stocks
  - Added loop to create 0-share snapshots
  - Added logging for visibility

### Tests Added
- **`API/tests/userStockHoldings.test.ts`** - New file (231 lines)
  - 5 test cases covering stock detection logic
  - Tests for edge cases (already zero, multiple snapshots, etc.)
  
- **`API/tests/stocks.test.ts`** - Updated (47 lines added)
  - Integration test verifying API returns 0 shares for sold stocks
  - Tests cleanup of holdings snapshots

### Documentation Created
- **`STOCK_HOLDINGS_FIX.md`** - Implementation details and rollback plan
- **`STOCK_HOLDINGS_FIX_FLOW.md`** - Visual flow diagrams
- **Demo script** - `/tmp/demo-stock-holdings-fix.js` for illustration

## Testing Status

✅ **TypeScript Compilation:** Passes (`npm run typecheck`)
✅ **Linting:** Passes (`npm run lint`)
✅ **Unit Tests Created:** 6 test cases covering the fix
✅ **Integration Test Added:** Verifies end-to-end behavior
✅ **Manual Verification:** Demo script shows before/after behavior

## How to Verify the Fix

### 1. Check Logs
After deploying, look for these log messages every 30 minutes:
```
Fetching user stock holdings...
Stock 25 no longer owned, creating 0-share snapshot
Stock 13 no longer owned, creating 0-share snapshot
Successfully saved 30 user stock holding snapshots to database
```

### 2. Database Query
Check for 0-share snapshots being created:
```javascript
db.userstockholdingsnapshots.find({ 
  total_shares: 0,
  timestamp: { $gte: new Date('2025-01-05') }
}).pretty()
```

### 3. API Test
After selling all shares of a stock, wait 30 minutes for the next fetch cycle, then:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/recommendations
```
Verify `owned_shares: 0` for the sold stock.

### 4. Frontend Verification
- Sell all shares of a stock
- Wait 30 minutes
- Refresh the stock recommendations page
- Verify the stock shows 0 shares (not the previous amount)

## Performance Impact

**Minimal:**
- One additional aggregation query per run (30-minute intervals)
- Query is indexed and filtered (only total_shares > 0)
- Typical result set: 0-10 stocks
- Additional storage: ~100 bytes per 0-share snapshot
- All snapshots subject to 14-day TTL cleanup

## Edge Cases Handled

1. ✅ User has never owned stocks → No queries run
2. ✅ User owns no stocks but API returns empty → 0-share snapshots created for all previous
3. ✅ User sells some stocks → Only sold stocks get 0-share snapshots
4. ✅ Stock already at 0 shares → Ignored (query filters these out)
5. ✅ Multiple snapshots per stock → Uses most recent via aggregation
6. ✅ First run after deployment → Works correctly with existing data

## Rollback Plan

If any issues arise:
1. Revert commit `deeb474` which contains the fix
2. Restart the application
3. No database changes needed (0-share snapshots are harmless and will expire via TTL)

```bash
git revert deeb474
git push
# Redeploy application
```

## Follow-up Monitoring

Monitor for the next 24 hours:
- Check logs for "no longer owned" messages
- Verify 0-share snapshots are being created
- Confirm no errors in background job execution
- User reports of stock holdings accuracy

## Related Issues

This fix follows the same pattern as the city shop stock tracking, which was working correctly. The issue was that stock holdings didn't implement the same "detect missing items" logic.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Linting passes
- [x] Tests written and pass locally
- [x] Documentation created
- [x] Code review ready
- [ ] Deployed to production (pending)

Issue identified: Stock holdings not clearing when stocks sold.
Root cause: API doesn't return sold stocks, no 0-share snapshots created.
Solution: Mirror city shop stock tracking pattern.
